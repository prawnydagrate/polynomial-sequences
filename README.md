# Polynomial sequences
My aim with this project is to investigate polynomial sequences, and:
* find a relationship between the degree of the polynomial and the
  * number of terms required to find the common difference
  * the common difference and the leading coefficient
* find a general 𝑛<sup>th</sup> term expression for any polynomial sequence of degree 𝑑
